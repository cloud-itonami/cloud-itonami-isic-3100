  "Demo driver -- `clojure -M:dev:run`. Walks a clean plant through
  intake -> maintenance scheduling (escalate/approve) -> safety-concern
  flag (escalate/approve) -> shipment coordination (escalate/approve),
  then shows HARD-hold scenarios: a mis-wired request whose own
  `:effect` is not `:propose`, an unrecognized op, maintenance
  scheduled against an UNVERIFIED/unregistered equipment unit, a
  shipment coordinated against an UNVERIFIED/unregistered batch, a
  shipment proposal that would exceed the batch's own logged
  production output, a proposal that tries to FINALIZE a cutting/
  joinery/finishing-line run (permanently blocked, no override), a
  double-schedule of the same maintenance window, a production-batch
  patch with a fabricated quality-grade, and a production-batch patch
  with an implausible defect-rate reading.

  Like every sibling actor's own demo, each check is exercised directly
  and independently below, one request per HARD-hold scenario, the SAME
  'exercise the failure mode directly, never only via a happy-path
  actuation' discipline `parksafety`'s ADR-2607071922 Decision 5 and
  every sibling since establish."
