(ns furnituremfg.advisor
  "FurnitureAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for the
  furniture-manufacturing plant-operations coordination actor.

  It normalizes production-batch patches (quality-grade/unit-count/
  defect-rate), drafts a cutting/sanding/finishing-line maintenance
  scheduling proposal against a piece of equipment, drafts a
  safety-concern flag (materials safety -- VOC finish-fume exposure,
  equipment safety, labor safety), and drafts an outbound-furniture-
  shipment coordination proposal against a production batch. CRITICAL:
  it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor. It returns a *proposal* (with a
  rationale + the fields it cited), never a committed record and NEVER
  a real cutting/joinery/finishing-line-equipment actuation, line-run
  execution, or freight dispatch. Every output is censored downstream
  by `furnituremfg.governor` before anything touches the SSoT -- see
  README `What this actor does NOT do`.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):

  CRITICAL invariant this advisor upholds: every request it is asked to
  route MUST itself carry `:effect :propose` (the request-level
  contract every caller of this actor agrees to) --
  `furnituremfg.governor` HARD-holds any request that doesn't, so a
  mis-wired caller can never reach a commit path even if this advisor
  were compromised."
